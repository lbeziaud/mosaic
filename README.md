See https://github.com/lbeziaud/re-reardon2018 for details on the replication.

## Content

The main model is [model.py](model.py). Figures are generated by [figures.ipynb](figures.ipynb). The file [utils_figs.py](utils_figs.py) contains auxiliary functions used for launching the experiments. 

## Requirements

This code has been written with Python 3.9. Required packages are listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/lbeziaud/mosaic
$ cd mosaic
```

2. Install dependencies (in a virtualenv)

```console
$ python3.9 -m venv venv  # create venv
$ source venv/bin/activate  # activate venv
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Generate the figures (run notebook in headless mode)

```console
(venv) $ jupyter nbconvert --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=-1 --to notebook --inplace --execute figures.ipynb
```

4. Running the model is done by calling `model.run`, which returns a tuple of dataframes:

```python
from model import run

colleges, students, outcomes = run()
```

Several examples are provided in [utils_figs.py](utils_figs.py) on how to cache the run and on how to run and aggregate repeated experiments.
